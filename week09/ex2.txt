In order to increase the hits and misses we should request the same page reference multiple consecutive times.
For example (3 page frames): 2 2 2 2 2 2 -> 5 hits, 1 misses
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the other hand in order to decrease them, we should request many different references with little repetitions.
For example (3 page frames): 1 2 3 4 5 6 -> 0 hits, 6 misses
